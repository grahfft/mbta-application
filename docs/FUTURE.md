# Future State of the Application

## GraphQL vs Rest
The way this assignment is presented, GraphQL would work better as we want to understand the MBTA based on the different Routes and Stops. GraphQL also provides a great mechanism for events. As the application progresses, there is information that can change such as delays and scheduling. These could be event handled instead of querying everytime.
